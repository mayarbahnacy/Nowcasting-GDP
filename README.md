# Nowcasting GDP

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on **nowcasting GDP**, which involves using high-frequency economic indicators to estimate the current or near-term state of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Nowcasting is essential for policymakers, businesses, and economists to make informed decisions without waiting for official GDP reports.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Loads relevant economic indicators from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends and correlations between indicators and GDP.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selects and transforms features for model training.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implements machine learning models to predict GDP.
- **Nowcasting GDP**: Generates real-time estimates of GDP based on current indicators.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the accuracy and reliability of the models.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels (if time series analysis is used)
- Any additional libraries required in the notebook

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells step by step to process data, train models, and generate GDP nowcasts.
3. Modify parameters or input data as needed to explore different scenarios.

## Expected Output
- Cleaned datasets ready for analysis.
- Visual insights into GDP and its predictors.
- Trained machine learning models for GDP nowcasting.
- Predictions and evaluation results for real-time GDP estimation.

## Applications
- **Economic Policy**: Helps policymakers adjust fiscal and monetary strategies.
- **Business Planning**: Assists companies in forecasting market conditions.
- **Investment Decisions**: Supports financial analysts in making informed predictions.
